Dear Ali, 

Hope this email finds you well. I had a few comments about the blasr aligner from reading I did on PacBio's paper (http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1471-2105-13-238.pdf), and was wondering if any of the recent changes the lab has made have already addressed it: 

1. BLASR expects contiguous anchors along a PacBio reads (either they all increase or decrease in genomic position - see page 10). How does this account for translocations or inversions of the sequence when compared to the reference? This would mean that all translocation or inversion breakpoints would not be alignable (only the sequences within them). Would it be possible to instead 'break' a long PacBio strobe read into multiple short reads and align those, then create penalties for the number of incontiguous short mappings along a read? This would be a possible scheme for finding PacBio reads that span SVs that blasr missed.

2. BLASR is based off of BWA-SW for the first and second step mapping (using an FM or SA index and then aligning seeds) but doesn't do reseeding like BWA-MEM when the anchor length is very long (as this paper points out http://arxiv.org/pdf/1303.3997v2.pdf, the best match between a read and the genome may incorporate read errors and is therefore inaccurate). Would this be a case of overfitting between reads and the genome, and may result in mismappings in BLASR? It would be nice to implement reseeding in BLASR to find possible mismappings.

3. BLASR limits the number of globally aligned anchor clusters when the alignment is repetitive - does this mean that the reads are unmapped or mismapped?

Have a wonderful evening, 
Ryan
